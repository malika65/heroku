# FullCustomer
Create a Database "Customers" with "customers" table with firstName, lastName, emailAddress, jobTitle, mobilePhone, city, webPage fields. Don't use in-memory DB. But if you would use any way it's not restricted, even though you won't be able to get full credits for these criteria.(+) Create a home page ("/", "index") that lists the "Welcome message" and link to the /customers web page which displays all customers. If the customers' web page is null display 'No customers" text. Use the same logic and format for the "Reading List" project as given in the book Spring Boot in Action.(+) Create "Customers" web page to list all existing customers in the DB or implement the REST call to retrieve all customers as JSON file.(+) Create "Add customer" form to add new customers to the "Customers" DB or implement the REST call to add new a customer to the DB.(+) Implement Spring Security for adding new customers.(+) Create your classes under corresponding packages (model, dao, controller, service, repository).(+) Any extra features could be also graded add added to the total grade. Bonus points will be decided after evaluations of your extra features. Any custom implementation must be commented inside the separate file ("README.md"). Create your views (in case you have them) under "resources/templates/" package.
